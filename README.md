# Cellulaire-automaten

This is our code for the final project for the course "Programmeren voor Wiskunde" (WISB152)
It consists of a generic class for Cellular Automata as well as two subclasses for 1D and 2D CAs.
At the moment it only really works for CAs with 2 states and a neighbourhood with the 2 (in 1D) or 8 (in 2D) touching cells.
Examples like Rule 30 (1D) and Conway's Game of Lufe (2D) can be found in the last few lines of the code.
